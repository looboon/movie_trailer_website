<h1>Project 1: Movie Trailer Website</h1>

This repository is my submission for Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd004). It contains the codes needed to run a Movie Trailer Website in your web browser. 

<h3>What the repo contains</h3>
The repo contains these three files:
1. entertainment_center.py: the main code that instantiates the movies as well as the web browser object
2. media.py: contains the Movie class definition that stores the different movies
3. fresh_tomatoes.py: contains the code used to generate the Movie trailer website given a list of movies

<h3>Requirements</h3>
You will need python 2.x to run this code. 

<h3>How to run this</h3>
Download this repository as a zip file or clone this to a directory of your choice using 
```
git clone 
```
Open your command line window (depending on your OS) and navigate to the directory where you have unzipped or cloned the repository. Type the following command:
```
python entertainment_center.py
```
The default browser will then open the Movie Trailer Website in a new window.
